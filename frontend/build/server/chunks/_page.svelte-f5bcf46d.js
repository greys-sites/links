<p>Oh, we don&#39;t collect anything. All that gets stored is
	what link was clicked and when it was clicked. We don&#39;t steal your cookies or save IPs or care about who you are. Promise!</p>

<h1>Oh, okay. Anything else I should know?</h1>
<p>You can check out some of our important links on <a href="/links">this page</a>!</p></div>`;
