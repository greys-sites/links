<h1>owo what's this?</h1>
<p>Hiya! You've found the main page for the <a href="https://github.com/greys-sites/links">link shortening site</a>
	made by greysdawn. This is just a landing page for it. Nothing to see here :) </p>

<h1>But what about privacy?</h1>
<p>Oh, we don't collect anything. All that gets stored is
	what link was clicked and when it was clicked. We don't steal your cookies or save IPs or care about who you are. Promise!</p>

<h1>Oh, okay. Anything else I should know?</h1>
<p>You can check out some of our important links on <a href="/links">this page</a>!</p>
